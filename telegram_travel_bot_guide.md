```json
{
  "memoryType": "bufferWindowMemory",
  "sessionKey": "{{ $json.chatId }}",
  "memoryKey": "chat_history",
  "returnMessages": true,
  "maxTokenLimit": 2000
}
```

### Phase 4: Agent Configuration

**1. Planning Agent Setup**
```text
// System Prompt
You are an expert travel planner. 
Your job is to parse a clients travel request and create a detailed, day-by-day plan. You must identify the destination, dates, number of travelers, kilometers travelled each day and interests. 
Always use Tavily tool to search for the latest and accurate information.
Then, you will create a high-level itinerary with a theme and key activities for each day. 
Do not provide any hotel or restaurant recommendations, prices, or external details. Focus solely on the itinerary structure and logistics. Format your output as a single JSON object. 
Do not add any conversational text before or after the JSON.
```
